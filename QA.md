## Which agent made the most calls? 
Orange

##For the leads that received one or more calls, how many calls were received on average? [2]
1.84


##For the leads that signed up, how many calls were received, on average? [2]
2.1


##Which agent had the most signups? Which assumptions did you make? (note that there is a many-to-one relationship between calls and leads) [4]
{'black': 65.83333333333336, 'orange': 308.4119047619046, 'green': 60.77142857142859, 'red': 286.93690476190466, 'blue': 46.046428571428585})


##Which agent had the most signups per call? [2]
success rate (sing up credits divided by calls made)
{'black': 0.08777777777777782, 'blue': 0.2313890882986361, 'green': 0.1792667509481669, 'orange': 0.13805367267766544, 'red': 0.19413863651008434}



##Was the variation between the agents’ signups-per-call statistically significant? Why? [5]

##A lead from which region is most likely to be “interested” in the product? [3]

##A lead from which sector is most likely to be “interested” in the product? [1]

##Given a lead has already expressed interest and signed up: 

###signups from which region are most likely to be approved? [2]

###Is this statistically significant? Why? [5]

##Suppose you wanted to pick the 1000 leads most likely to sign up (who have not been called so far), based only on age, sector and region.

###What criteria would you use to pick those leads? [10]

###In what sense are those an optimal criteria set? [3]

###How many signups would you expect to get based on those called leads, assuming they were being called by random agents? [3]

###If you could choose the agents to make those calls, who would you choose? Why? [3]

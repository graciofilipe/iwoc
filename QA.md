##Which agent had the most signups? Which assumptions did you make? (note that there is a many-to-one relationship between calls and leads) [4]







##Which agent had the most signups per call? [2]

##Was the variation between the agents’ signups-per-call statistically significant? Why? [5]

##A lead from which region is most likely to be “interested” in the product? [3]

##A lead from which sector is most likely to be “interested” in the product? [1]

##Given a lead has already expressed interest and signed up, 

##signups from which region are most likely to be approved? [2]

##Is this statistically significant? Why? [5]

##Suppose you wanted to pick the 1000 leads most likely to sign up (who have not been called so far), based only on age, sector and region.

##What criteria would you use to pick those leads? [10]

##In what sense are those an optimal criteria set? [3]

##How many signups would you expect to get based on those called leads, assuming they were being called by random agents? [3]

##If you could choose the agents to make those calls, who would you choose? Why? [3]
